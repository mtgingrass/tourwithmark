# Slaughter Pen

I was fortunate enough to be able to stop in Bentonville, Arkansas, on my two-week-long epic road trip. So naturally, I wanted to pass through this area for their world-renowned mountain bike trails. Even though I was only here for a hot minute, it did not disappoint. The terrain was engineered for every skill level and is very well maintained. So if you visit here, you will be in for a mountain bike ride.

I *borrowed* this photo from [Arkansas Insider](https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106043008186601737362) off the Google search results page for \"Slaughter Pen Trail.\"

The incredible thing about this place is that it\'s completely embedded into the city\'s downtown district. It\'s a mountain biker\'s dreamland.

## Location and Trails

Trail Forks, MTP Project, All Trails, and the like are fantastic apps for finding trails. However, I feel they are missing a few key elements. For one, they don\'t show how to get to the trail heads! I can\'t stand that. Perhaps it\'s something I just don\'t know how to use on the apps. But I digress; here is a [link](https://g.page/slaughter-pen-trail?share) using Google Maps.

You can find the Slaughter Pen map on Trail Forks [here](https://www.trailforks.com/region/slaughter-pen-trails/). Trail Forks is showing over 15 trails for this system. Not too bad for downtown. You can ride then grab a beer or a burger afterwards.

## My Experience

I am a  beginner with an athletic background. I found this little drop after not riding for almost 2.5 months due to a knee injury. Not the best phot extract from my [GoPro Hero 10](https://amzn.to/3Ru3h9O) video, but it was a thrill to find a drop in the middle of downtown Bentonville.

I only rode for about an hour but found nothing but incredible terrain the entire time.

## After Hours Beer

Without hesitation, the Bentonville [Dive Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/br1H9xoHpqYJozrd7) for the after-ride beer is the place to go.
