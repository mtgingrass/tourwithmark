summary: The Upper Gauley is the pinnacle of whitewater experiences and for experienced rafters only. This 11-mile section of the river requires all the paddling power you can muster and may be the most extreme trip most rafters will ever attempt. This is serious whitewater, and it’s an adventure you won’t forget!

<h1>Adventures on the Gorge</h1>
<p>I spent the weekend at Adventures on the Gorge with my girlfriend, Liz. We are both pretty adventurous and wanted this type of thrill. The check-in process was easy, and the front desk folks were very nice. We camped on the resort property the first night in one of the many camping areas. The facilities were pristine and well maintained. Our guide, KP, was extremely knowledgeable and fun to chat with on this trip. Overall, the river and rapids exceeded our expectations, and we would 100% make this trip again. We are already planning for more!</p>

<h1>Sliders at Rendezvous Lodge Bar</h1>
<p>We showed up hungry at the <a href="https://adventuresonthegorge.com/venue/rendezvous-river-lodge/">Rendezvous Lodge Bar</a>. So, we went to the bartender to order food, and the only thing on the menu were sliders. The sliders were pretty big, and it was plenty for two people. Not bad for $3 bucks! Not to mention that they were delicious. Excellent beer selection, and the prices were not bad at all.</p>
<p>At the bar, there was also live music playing (<span class="citation">@GrizzleyGoat</span>), a good amount of people, and everyone seemed friendly. They have a cornhole area, a fire pit, and a volleyball court. Everything you would expect outdoors to be.</p>

<h1>Chetty’s Pub</h1>
<p>Fantastic pub on site at Adventures on the Gorge. Great views with an outdoor patio. On the patio, you are overlooking the mountains and the river.</p>
<p>This pub is where they played the rafting videos after the trip. Everyone was super into watching the videos and drinking the beer. A great atmosphere to be around for sure. The burger was delicious, too.</p>

<div id="the-morning-of-the-trip" class="section level1">
<h1>The morning of the trip</h1>
<p>They asked us to show up an hour early, so, instead of 9:30 AM, we should up around 8:30 AM. This gave us plenty of time to grab some wet suits (you can rent them on site the morning of - at least we did). We paid $88 for two wet suits and two jackets for two full days. I’m sure they are a bit cheaper if you do only one day rental. Either way, we are glad we brought them for the first day. The second day was warmer so there was no need for them. Still, worth it.</p>
<p>Grab your gear from you car you want to have at the campsite for the overnighter. We just piled it all in the Uhaul.</p>
<p>If I were to do this a second time, I could have showed up at 9:15 and still made the trip no problem. However, it’s best to just get there early because you never know.</p>

<h1>Upper Gauley</h1>
<p>A little practice run before the rapid. All the rocks have names. “If a rapid is named after you - you did nothing good.” - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kpraftguide/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D"><span class="citation">@KPRaftGuide</span></a></p>
<p>Lost Paddle - Named after the first female raft guide down the Gauley. She lost her paddle. It was hung above the rapid until someone stole it.</p>

<div id="camping-and-food" class="section level1">
<h1>Camping and Food</h1>
<p>Gravel tent area, covered picnic tables, big fire pit. Hot showers. Great food. Lots of beer. Lots of place to party and places to chill and relax. You can even go for a hike.</p>

<h1>Ray Ray</h1>
<p>Ray Ray all day. This guy was super funny. I think I laughed at 100% of his jokes. I would have thought he was a comedian. He’s serious, but funny. He definitely does not want you to drown on that river!</p>
