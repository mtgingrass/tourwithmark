<h1>Adventures on the Gorge</h1>
<p>I spent the weekend at Adventures on the Gorge with my girlfriend, Liz. We are both pretty adventurous and wanted this type of thrill. The check-in process was easy, and the front desk folks were very nice. We camped on the resort property the first night in one of the many camping areas. The facilities were pristine and well maintained. Our guide, KP, was extremely knowledgeable and fun to chat with on this trip. Overall, the river and rapids exceeded our expectations, and we would 100% make this trip again. We are already planning for more!</p>

<h2>Deluxe Gauley River Overnight</h2>

<h1>Sliders at Rendezvous Lodge Bar</h1>
<p>We showed up hungry at the <a href="https://adventuresonthegorge.com/venue/rendezvous-river-lodge/">Rendezvous Lodge Bar</a>. So, we went to the bartender to order food, and the only thing on the menu were sliders. The sliders were pretty big, and it was plenty for two people. Not bad for $3 bucks! Not to mention that they were delicious. Excellent beer selection, and the prices were not bad at all.</p>
<p>At the bar, there was also live music playing (<span class="citation">@GrizzleyGoat</span>), a good amount of people, and everyone seemed friendly. They have a cornhole area, a fire pit, and a volleyball court. Everything you would expect outdoors to be.</p>

<h1>Upper Gauley</h1>
<p>NOTES: A little practice run before the rapid. All the rocks have names. If a rapid si named after you - you did nothing good - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kpraftguide/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D"><span class="citation">@KPRaftGuide</span></a></p>
<p>Lost Paddle - Named after the first female raft guide down the Gauley. She lost her paddle. It was hung above the rapid until someone stole it.</p>
