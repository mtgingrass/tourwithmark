summary: For the Rapid City area (or, let's face it, all of South Dakota and part of Nebraska, too), this water park is super fun. Despite its compact size, there is a lot to do, but it can get jam-packed. There is a cool bar with one transparent water slide going through it.

## WaTikie Water Park

This water park is super fun for the Rapid City area (or, let's face it, all of South Dakota and part of Nebraska too). There is a lot to do for its compact size, but it can get jam-packed. There is a cool bar with one transparent slide going through it. Your kiddo will fly by in the tube while you are sipping on a delicious IPA. They also have a restaurant, arcades, and a few other attractions, all in the same area.

I used my [GoPro](https://amzn.to/3JLRdgN)  to film a quick tour. See the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EgmwEbeoFs&feature=emb_imp_woyt), below.

The staff does an excellent job but watch the younger kids because it does get packed. They allow anyone to use the water park even if you are not staying at the connecting hotels. Weekdays are less busy but sometimes have limited hours. The tables fill up so quickly, so grab one when you can. I usually find a spot along the wall to put my stuff down (hiding valuables in my shoe).

There are slides, a lazy river, a small obstacle course pool that seems to always be heated more than the others, a hot tub, and a little kid area to choose from. Also, there are tonnes of floats to just lay on and float. The lazy river is only about three feet deep, which is slightly disappointing. However, the kids seem to love it. The air temperature is always great, even on the coldest days. It's nice knowing it's snowing and frigid outside while we are all inside basking in the glory of the heated pools!
