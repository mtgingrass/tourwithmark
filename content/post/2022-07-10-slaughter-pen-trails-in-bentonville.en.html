<h1>Slaughter Pen</h1>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be able to stop in Bentonville, Arkansas, on my two-week-long epic road trip. So naturally, I wanted to pass through this area for their world-renowned mountain bike trails. Even though I was only here for a hot minute, it did not disappoint. The terrain was engineered for every skill level and is very well maintained. So if you visit here, you will be in for a mountain bike ride.</p>
<p>I <em>borrowed</em> this photo from <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106043008186601737362">Arkansas Insider</a> off the Google search results page for "Slaughter Pen Trail."</p>

<p>The incredible thing about this place is that it's completely embedded into the city's downtown district. It's a mountain biker's dreamland.</p>

<h2>Location and Trails</h2>
<p>Trail Forks, MTP Project, All Trails, and the like are fantastic apps for finding trails. However, I feel they are missing a few key elements. For one, they don't show how to get to the trail heads! I can't stand that. Perhaps it's something I just don't know how to use on the apps. But I digress; here is a <a href="https://g.page/slaughter-pen-trail?share">link</a> using Google Maps.</p>

<p>You can find the Slaughter Pen map on Trail Forks <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/region/slaughter-pen-trails/">here</a>. Trail Forks is showing over 15 trails for this system. Not too bad for downtown. You can ride then grab a beer or a burger afterwards.</p>
