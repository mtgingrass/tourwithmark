# Coler Mountain

Coler Mountain offers outstanding trails and even has a walk-in coffee shop called [Airship Coffee](https://airshipcoffee.com/). They also serve food and snacks. I'm not sure if they have wi-fi or not, but it's an excellent spot, regardless. Here is a [Google link](https://g.page/Airship-Coler?share) for those who want to check it out. Coler Mountain is a  must-do, whether you are a local or a visitor. As usual, the full video was shot with the [GoPro Hero 10 (Amazon Affilate Link)](https://amzn.to/3frhrdn).

## Airship Coffee

Before I get into the camping, let's talk coffee. The Airship Coffee shop is the perfect destination cafe. Nothing like having a solid espresso and then hitting the trails. I wish we had one of these where I live because I'd probably go every day! This little shop is nestled right in with the trail system super close to the campgrounds.

## Camping

My camping experience at [Coler Campground](https://www.peelcompton.org/coler-mountain-bike-preserve/camping/) was great. They have updated large, clean, and air-conditioned bathrooms. The AC was essential after a long hot ride in late July summer heat. The showers have <b>hot</b> water.The site has little trolleys to haul your gear to the tent platform and campfire wood for sale. There is a community fire pit, but I did not get to use it or see anyone else utilize itâ€”a solid choice for any family.

## Location

I cannot say enough good things about this place. I never thought I would like Arkansas, but this place inspired me to think about moving to NW, Arkansas. What other city has world-class trails as an amenity for downtown? Bentonville is truly a place for anyone who enjoys mountain biking and the outdoors. There is something here for all skill levels, from easy and flat trails or big drops. 

You will also find many stops with bike repair tools and pumps near the preserve. Unfortunately, cease & Desist was closed when I arrived, but both Rock Soft and Rock Solid were, solid.
