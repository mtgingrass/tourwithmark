summary: I was looking for trails near Las Vegas, Nevada. This 8-mile trail was my answer. It was brutally hot! I believe this is considered a moderate route. I happened to get lost a bit but found my way, eventually. The view of the city is cool from atop the mountain, too. There is absolutely no shade, so prepare well for the heat. In the end, the downhill section was worth it.

There is absolutely no shade, so prepare well for the heat. In the end, the downhill section was worth it.
