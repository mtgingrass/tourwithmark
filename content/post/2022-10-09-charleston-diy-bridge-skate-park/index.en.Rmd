summary: The downtown Charleston, Do It Yourself (DIY) Bridge Spot is a favorite for skateboarders. It’s free, the skaters build it, and it’s out of sight, out of mind. Unfortunately, that’s the issue; people find it hard to find this spot. This brief blog post will discuss how to get here, where to park, and some other hidden gems.

Welcome to Tour With Mark (tourwithmark.com). The best place to follow my random adventures. I like to post raw, unedited footage to see the real deal. I’ll try to provide short clips for Tic Tok and impatient ones, but I make no promises.

## Location & Parking

Use [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/L6rWvH6QttvnuVrX9) or [Apple Maps](https://maps.apple.com/?address=289%20Huger%20St,%20Charleston,%20SC%20%2029403,%20United%20States&auid=9871147643011338615&ll=32.801298,-79.945893&lsp=9902&q=Palmetto%20Brewing&_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhBoCgQIChAACgQIUhABCgQIVRAPCgQIWRACCgUIpAEQARImKYCC5r/9ZUBAMZ6qVA3h/FPAOf5XDBwkZ0BAQXDZD/Qx/FPAUAQ%3D) and look for “Palmetto Brewing Company.” Once you find it, you will see a bridge adjacent to the brewing company. Park right under the bridge, and you are golding. 

I marked the two areas you can park in the diagram below. The lower P is easier to park at because there are not a lot of divots and holes in the ground. However, you must walk across the street and go to the other parking area to find the DIY Bridge Spot. The lower P has plenty of parking but drive very slow due to the potholes and unpaved sections. Both parking areas are safe, and law enforcement won't’ mess with you.
