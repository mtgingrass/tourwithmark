summary: The downtown Charleston, Do It Yourself (DIY) Bridge Spot is a favorite for skateboarders. It’s free, the skaters build it, and it’s out of sight, out of mind. Unfortunately, that’s the issue; people find it hard to find this spot. This brief blog post will discuss how to get here, where to park, and some other hidden gems.

<p>Welcome to Tour With Mark (tourwithmark.com). The best place to follow my random adventures. I like to post raw, unedited footage to see the real deal. I’ll try to provide short clips for Tic Tok and impatient ones, but I make no promises.</p>

<h2>Location &amp; Parking</h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/L6rWvH6QttvnuVrX9">Google Maps</a> or <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=289%20Huger%20St,%20Charleston,%20SC%20%2029403,%20United%20States&amp;auid=9871147643011338615&amp;ll=32.801298,-79.945893&amp;lsp=9902&amp;q=Palmetto%20Brewing&amp;_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhBoCgQIChAACgQIUhABCgQIVRAPCgQIWRACCgUIpAEQARImKYCC5r/9ZUBAMZ6qVA3h/FPAOf5XDBwkZ0BAQXDZD/Qx/FPAUAQ%3D">Apple Maps</a> and look for “Palmetto Brewing Company.” Once you find it, you will see a bridge adjacent to the brewing company. Park right under the bridge, and you are golding.</p>
<p>I marked the two areas you can park in the diagram below. The lower P is easier to park at because there are not a lot of divots and holes in the ground. However, you must walk across the street and go to the other parking area to find the DIY Bridge Spot. The lower P has plenty of parking but drive very slow due to the potholes and unpaved sections. Both parking areas are safe, and law enforcement won’t’ mess with you.</p>
